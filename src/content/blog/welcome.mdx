# Why I Created This Blog

After spending a few years in the cybersecurity industry, I've come to realize how valuable maintaining a personal blog can be. It's not just about building a professional presence onlineâ€”though that's certainly part of itâ€”but also about holding myself accountable to keep learning and growing.

This space gives me a place to document what I'm working on for those who might be interested in following along. That's also why I've set up a newsletter you can subscribe to if you want regular updates.

Beyond the professional benefits, this project also gave me an opportunity to work with React and Next.js which I've been meaning to get better at.

Anyways, welcome to my website and blog! Stay tuned for some awesome security content ðŸ˜Ž!
